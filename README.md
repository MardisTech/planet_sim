# planet_sim
Planet Simulation with Newtonian Physics using the real values of mass, distance, velocity, time (proportioned appropriates), and physical constants as described by the astrophysical literature.

Template by "TechwithTim".

I added the rest of the planets and changed the distance scaling and window size to fit the whole solar system (up to neptune, the farthest planet).

Added buttons to add a black hole, sun-like star, and/or Jupiter-like planet. The added astrophysical objects enter at a trajectory that represents a rogue object. The added objects interact with the system using the same Newtonian gravity as the systems starting objects. This makes the simulation more unpredictable and fun, as it shows what would actually happen to our solar system if a rogue object passed through the gravity regime of our sun.
